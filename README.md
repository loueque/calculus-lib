# Calculus-lib
A library that revolves around the center of the basics of calculus (Calculus I, II, and III); this library includes theorms, equations, and systematic backend functions that includes
* Derivatives
* Limits
* Integral (surface, for now)...
* L'Hopital rule

There will be future methods and functions such as infinite series, infinite limits, parametric equations and possibly multivariable calculus in ~4-5 months.
